# XploRer

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)  
[![R build status](https://github.com/VEZY/XploRer/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VEZY/XploRer/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of XploRer is to read, write, analyze and plot MTG (Multi-scale Tree Graph) files. These files describe the plant topology (i.e. structure) along with some attributes for each node (e.g. geometry, colors, state...). 

> The package is under intensive development and is in a very early version. The functions may heavily change from one version to another until a more stable version is released.

## 1. Installation


you can install the release version of XploRer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("VEZY/XploRer")
```

## 2. Examples

### 2.1 Reading a file

Read a simple MTG file:

```{r example}
library(XploRer)

MTG = read_mtg("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEZY/XploRer/master/inst/extdata/simple_plant.mtg")
```

The `read_mtg()` function returns a list of 4: 

- classes: a `data.frame` that holds information about the type of nodes used in the MTG (e.g. Internode, Leaf, etc...), the MTG scale for each one, and some more details. Here is the classes `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$classes
    ```

- description: a `data.frame` defining the potential topological constraints existing between nodes. Here is the description `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$description
    ```

- features: a `data.frame` listing all attributes present in the file and their associated type. Here is the features `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$features
    ```

- MTG: a `data.tree` structure defining all nodes, their attributes and their relationships:

    ```{r}
    MTG$MTG
    ```

### 2.2 Mutate the MTG

The attributes (also known as features or variables) of the MTG can be mutated using `mutate_mtg()`. It allows to compute new variables, or modify the existing ones.

#### Compute new variables

`mutate_mtg()` borrows its syntax from `dplyr`. We can compute a new variable based on the values of others: 
```{r}
# Import the MTG:
filepath= system.file("extdata", "simple_plant.mtg", package = "XploRer")
MTG = read_mtg(filepath)

# And mutate it by adding two new variables, Length2 and Length3:
mutate_mtg(MTG, Length2 = node$Length + 2, Length3 = node$Length2 * 2)
```

We can note two things here:

1. We use `node$` to access the values of a variable inside the MTG. This is done to avoid any conflicts between variables from the MTG, and variables from your environment;  

1. `Length3` uses the results of `Length2` before it even exist. This is very powerful to construct many new variables at once. It is allowed thanks to a sequential construction of the variables.

As with `dplyr` main functions, `mutate_mtg()` can be used with pipes: 

```{r}
read_mtg(filepath)%>%
  mutate_mtg(Length2 = node$Length + 2)
```

This is allowed because the function returns the results invisibly. Note that it is mutating the MTG in place though, so no need to assign the results of `mutate_mtg()` to a variable. 

You can also use functions inside the call of the function. Some helpers are provided by the package to compute variables based on the parents or children of the node (see `get_parent_value()` and `get_children_value()`). Here is an example were we define a new variable called `Length_parent` that is the length of the node's parent:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, Length_parent = get_parent_value("Length"))
```

We can also make more complex associations. Here is an example were we need the sum of the surface of the section of all children for the nodes:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, section_surface = pi * ((node$Width / 2)^2),
           s_surf_child_sum = sum(get_children_values("section_surface"),na.rm=TRUE))
```

We first compute the surface of the section of each node, and then we sum the values for all children of the nodes. This is helpful to check if our MTG follows the pipe model.

The results can be viewed using the functions from the `data.tree` package:

```{r}
data.tree::ToDataFrameTree(MTG$MTG,"Length","Length2","Length3","Length_parent","section_surface","s_surf_child_sum")
```

### 2.3 Plotting a plant

#### 2.3.1 Static plot

The plant topology can be plotted using the `autoplot()` function. This function is implemented by `ggplot2` so you'll need to load this package before-hand: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
autoplot(MTG)
```

The function can be used in a pipe, such as:

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_mtg(filepath)%>%
  mutate_mtg(Length2 = node$Length + 2)%>%
  autoplot(.)
```

#### 2.3.2 Interactive plot

The same plot can be rendered as an interactive plot using: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotly_MTG(MTG)
```

![Interactive plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEZY/XploRer/master/www/plotly_MTG.gif)

`plotly_MTG()` uses the [plotly API](https://plotly.com/) under the hood. 

It is also possible to add any variable in the tooltip appearing on hover of a node by adding it to the call. For example if we need the `Length` and the `Width` of the nodes, we would write:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotly_mtg(MTG, Length, Width)
```


## 3. Help

Please see the [OpenAlea documentation](http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/vplants/newmtg/doc/_build/html/contents.html) (especially chapter 8) for more details on the MTG files.

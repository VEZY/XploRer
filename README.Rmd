# XploRer

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)  
[![R build status](https://github.com/VEZY/XploRer/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VEZY/XploRer/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of XploRer is to read, write, analyze and plot MTG (Multi-scale Tree Graph) files. These files describe the plant topology (i.e. structure) along with some attributes for each node (e.g. geometry, colors, state...). 

> The package is under intensive development and is in a very early version. The functions may heavily change from one version to another until a more stable version is released.

## 1. Installation


you can install the release version of XploRer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("VEZY/XploRer")
```

## 2. Examples

### 2.1 Reading a file

Read a simple MTG file:

```{r example}
library(XploRer)

MTG = read_mtg("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEZY/XploRer/master/inst/extdata/simple_plant.mtg")
```

The `read_mtg()` function returns a list of 4: 

- classes: a `data.frame` that holds information about the type of nodes used in the MTG (e.g. Internode, Leaf, etc...), the MTG scale for each one, and some more details. Here is the classes `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$classes
    ```

- description: a `data.frame` defining the potential topological constraints existing between nodes. Here is the description `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$description
    ```

- features: a `data.frame` listing all attributes present in the file and their associated type. Here is the features `data.frame` from our example:

    ```{r}
    MTG$features
    ```

- MTG: a `data.tree` structure defining all nodes, their attributes and their relationships:

    ```{r}
    MTG$MTG
    ```

#### 2.2 Print/extract variables

The variables / attributes of an MTG can be printed using the `print()` function on the MTG field, *e.g.*:

```{r}
print(MTG$MTG, ".symbol", "Length")
```


The variables can also be extracted in a `data.frame()` using the functions from the `data.tree` package *e.g.*:

```{r}
data.tree::ToDataFrameTree(MTG$MTG,"Length","Width")
```


### 2.3 Mutate the MTG

The attributes (also known as features or variables) of the MTG can be mutated using `mutate_mtg()`. It allows to compute new variables, or modify the existing ones.

#### 2.3.1 Compute new variables

`mutate_mtg()` borrows its syntax from `dplyr`. We can compute a new variable based on the values of others: 
```{r}
# Import the MTG:
filepath= system.file("extdata", "simple_plant.mtg", package = "XploRer")
MTG = read_mtg(filepath)

# And mutate it by adding two new variables, Length2 and Length3:
mutate_mtg(MTG, Length2 = node$Length + 2, Length3 = node$Length2 * 2)

print(MTG$MTG, ".symbol", "Length", "Length2", "Length3")
```

We can note two things here:

1. We use `node$` to access the values of a variable inside the MTG. This is done to avoid any conflicts between variables from the MTG, and variables from your environment;  

1. `Length3` uses the results of `Length2` before it even exist. This is very powerful to construct many new variables at once. It is allowed thanks to a sequential construction of the variables.

As with `dplyr` main functions, `mutate_mtg()` can be used with pipes: 

```{r}
read_mtg(filepath)%>%
  mutate_mtg(Length2 = node$Length + 2)
```

This is allowed because the function returns the results invisibly. Note that it is mutating the MTG in place though, so no need to assign the results of `mutate_mtg()` to a variable. 

#### 2.3.2 Using parent values

You can also use functions inside the call. Some helpers are provided by the package to compute variables based on the ancestors or children of the node (see `get_parent_value()`, `get_children_values()` and `get_ancestors_values()`). Here is an example were we define a new variable called `Length_parent` that is the length of the node's parent:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, Length_parent = get_parent_value("Length"))
```

`get_parent_value()` is used to get the value of the "Length" variable from the parent of each node. 

If we need the values of all ancestors of a node along the tree, we can use `get_ancestors_values()` instead:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, total_length = sum(get_ancestors_values("Length",self = TRUE),na.rm = TRUE))
```

Here are the results for both:

```{r}
print(MTG$MTG,".symbol","Length","Length_parent","total_length")
```

#### 2.3.3 Using children values

To get the children values of a node, use `get_children_values()`. This function returns the values of a field for all children of a node:

```{r}
get_children_values(attribute = "Length", node = data.tree::FindNode(MTG$MTG, "node_3"))
```

It can be used to get *e.g.* the average length of the children:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, children_length = mean(get_children_values("Length"), na.rm = TRUE))
print(MTG$MTG, ".symbol", "Length","children_length")
```

#### 2.2.4 Combine values

We can also make more complex associations. Here is an example were we need the sum of the surface of the section of all children for the nodes:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, section_surface = pi * ((node$Width / 2)^2),
           s_surf_child_sum = sum(get_children_values("section_surface"),na.rm=TRUE))
```

We first compute the surface of the section of each node, and then we sum the values for all children of the nodes. The `s_surf_child_sum` variable uses the `section_surface` variable that was just created before.

#### 2.2.5 Filter by scale

We can also filter the parent by scale, *i.e.* the name of the SYMBOL from the MTG classes, which corresponds to the `.symbol` value in the node.

To get the possible values for the SYMBOLS in an MTG:

```{r}
MTG$classes$SYMBOL
```

To get the symbol of a node use the `.symbol` field on a node:

```{r}
MTG$MTG$.symbol
```

To filter the parent node by its scale, use the `scale` argument:

```{r}
get_parent_value(attribute = "Length", node = data.tree::FindNode(MTG$MTG, "node_6"), scale = "Axis")
```

Here it returns `NA` because the first parent is an `Internode`, and the first node with scale "Axis" (`node_2`) has no values for "Length", see by yourself:

```{r}
print(MTG$MTG, ".symbol", "Length")
```

Several functions implements their own way to deal with scales. `get_parent_value()`, `get_ancestors_values()` and `get_children_values()` all share a `scale` argument to filter the parents by scale. By default, the function will return the values from the first ancestor with the required scale by "climbing" the tree from one node to the other (starting from the node of interest). If none of the ancestors are of the required scale, then the function returns `NA`. 

The `recursive` argument can be used in `get_parent_value()` and `get_children_values()` functions to disable this default behavior of "climbing", so the function will return `NA` if the first parent is not of the right scale.

Here is an example with recursive behavior:

```{r}
get_children_values(attribute = "Length", node = MTG$MTG$node_2, scale = "Leaf")
```

And without:

```{r}
get_children_values(attribute = "Length", node = MTG$MTG$node_2, scale = "Leaf", recursive = FALSE)
```
Here it returns `NA` because "node_2" has one child ("node_3") that is not of the right scale, but `recursive = FALSE` so the function just returns `NA`. 


> Note that `get_ancestors_values()` does not have the `recursive` argument because it is a recursive function by design. So if an ancestor is not of the right scale, it just jumps to the next ancestor.

`mutate_mtg()` has a `.scale` argument that is used similarly to the `scale` argument of the other functions. The only difference is that the functions inside a `mutate_mtg()` call will only be applied to the nodes of the chosen scales, but once the function called, it will still have access to the node parents and children if needed. Furthermore, the `.scale` argument is applied to all functions inside the `mutate_mtg()` call. 

There can be a benefit in combining the `.scale` argument from `mutate_mtg()` and then the `scale` argument from the other functions in a single call. If you need a computation at one scale for a variable but at another scale for another, it is preferable to use multiple calls to `mutate_mtg()`, possibly chained using a pipe, *e.g.*:

```{r}
mutate_mtg(MTG, section_surface = pi * ((node$Width / 2)^2),
          .scale = "Internode")%>%
mutate_mtg(area = node$Width * node$Length, .scale = "Leaf")

print(MTG$MTG, ".symbol", "Width","section_surface", "area")
```


### 2.3 Plotting a plant

#### 2.3.1 Static plot

The plant topology can be plotted using the `autoplot()` function. This function is implemented by `ggplot2` so you'll need to load this package before-hand: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
autoplot(MTG)
```

The function can be used in a pipe, such as:

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_mtg(filepath)%>%
  mutate_mtg(Length2 = node$Length + 2)%>%
  autoplot(.)
```

#### 2.3.2 Interactive plot

The same plot can be rendered as an interactive plot using: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotly_MTG(MTG)
```

![Interactive plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEZY/XploRer/master/www/plotly_MTG.gif)

`plotly_MTG()` uses the [plotly API](https://plotly.com/) under the hood. 

It is also possible to add any variable in the tooltip appearing on hover of a node by adding it to the call. For example if we need the `Length` and the `Width` of the nodes, we would write:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotly_mtg(MTG, Length, Width)
```

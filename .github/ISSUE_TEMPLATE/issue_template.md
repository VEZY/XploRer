Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, you can also ask it on <https://stackoverflow.com/>.

If you report a bug, please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

If you request a feature, please state clearly what would you expect to get and if you can how. If you want to develop the feature yourself, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://vezy.github.io/XploRer/CONTRIBUTING.html), there are a lot of hints that can help you.
